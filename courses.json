This course requires students to go out into global society and industry companies beyond (China, Hong Kong, Korea) for seeking and defining a global user-centered design problem by themselves, to develop the engineering design alternative to solve it, and then to build a working critical function prototype. Through the course, students will cultivate the ability of “global first movers,” who can develop a product and technology which has not existed before. This course requires to execute a design project by composing a global and interdisciplinary design team, which consists of students from the three universities. Students will collaborate through online tools as well as 3 face-to-face meetings throughout the semester in the three respective campuses.

Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts.

It demonstrates that far from being isolated, the two areas overlap, and in reality are bonded by political, cultural and ethnic ties. Analysis of historical data provides a vibrant perspective for understanding Southwest China, not as an area at the margins of Chinese and SEA history, but as a vital link in a chain that connects SEA with the worlds of China and Tibet.

A review on the economic aspects in the aerospace sector is first given. This is followed by market analysis methods, analysis of development cost of new technologies and its impact on aircraft project. Development schedule, the unit cost of aircraft, and life cycle cost of aircraft programs are also discussed. From airlines’ perspective, the concept and methods of operating cost are described, along with discussions on differentiation factors between low cost and major airlines. Other areas covered include cost estimation relations, economic implications of environmental impact, and engine program cost. Value driven design and design for economics is given in the last few lectures to illustrate that how economic analysis methods can be used in aircraft design process to provide added value. Some brief discussions on UAV costing is also given."},"sections":[{"name":"L1 (3810)","classes":[{"day":"Saturday","start_time":"2017-08-27T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-27T04:50:00.000Z","location":"Rm 2302, Lift 17-18 (74)","note":"02-SEP-2017 - 16-SEP-2017"},{"day":"Saturday","start_time":"2017-08-27T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-27T04:50:00.000Z","location":"Rm 2504, Lift 25-26 (84)","note":"23-SEP-2017 - 23-SEP-2017"},{"day":"Saturday","start_time":"2017-08-27T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-27T04:50:00.000Z","location":"Rm 2302, Lift 17-18 (74)","note":"30-SEP-2017 - 25-NOV-2017"}]}]},{"title":"AESF 6950A - Aeronautical Independent Project (3 units)","heading":{"id":"AESF6950A","department":"AESF","code":"6950A","name":"Aeronautical Independent Project","credit":"3"},"details":{"VECTOR":"[3 credits]","DESCRIPTION":"An independent research project on Aeronautical Engineering carried out under the supervision of a faculty member."},"sections":[{"name":"R1 (3881)","classes":"TBA"}]},{"title":"AESF 6950B - Aeronautical Independent Project (6 units)","heading":{"id":"AESF6950B","department":"AESF","code":"6950B","name":"Aeronautical Independent Project","credit":"6"},"details":{"VECTOR":"[6 credits]","DESCRIPTION":"An independent research project on Aeronautical Engineering carried out under the supervision of a faculty member."},"sections":[{"name":"R1 (3882)","classes":"TBA"}]},{"title":"MECH 1902 - Energy Systems in a Sustainable World (3 units)","heading":{"id":"MECH1902","department":"MECH","code":"1902","name":"Energy Systems in a Sustainable World","credit":"3"},"details":{"ATTRIBUTES":"Common Core (S&T) for 2010 & 2011 3Y programs|Common Core (SA special list) for 10&11 3Yprograms|Common Core (SA) for 2010 & 2011 3Y programs|Common Core (S&T) for 2012 3Y programs|Common Core (SA) for 2012 3Y programs|Common Core (S&T) for 4Y programs|Common Core (SA) for 4Y programs","DESCRIPTION":"Various fuels used by mankind, fossil and renewable sources; power generation technologies and the controversies; energy efficient technologies and the applications in buildings and consumable products; energy efficient manufacturing technologies; low energy infrastructure and impact to modern life style; myths behind sustainable energy systems and the debates; energy entrepreneurship, case studies and social impact."},"sections":[{"name":"L1 (3332)","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2017-08-27T05:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-27T06:50:00.000Z","location":"Rm 2465, Lift 25-26 (122)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2017-08-27T01:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-27T02:20:00.000Z","location":"Rm 2465, Lift 25-26 (122)","note":"N/A"}]}]},{"title":"MECH 1906 - Mechanical Engineering for Modern Life (3 units)","heading":{"id":"MECH1906","department":"MECH","code":"1906","name":"Mechanical Engineering for Modern Life","credit":"3"},"details":{"ATTRIBUTES":"Common Core (S&T) for 2010 & 2011 3Y programs|Common Core (S&T) for 2012 3Y programs|Common Core (S&T) for 4Y programs","DESCRIPTION":"Mechanical Engineering covers the broadest range of engineering amongst all related disciplines.
