Students are grouped to design and build scaled building models using wood, glue, strings and rubber bands, which are loaded and tested on a shake table under simulated earthquake ground motion. Through the design, build and test process, students can observe the effect of different design variables and details on the test result. Students are then guided to interpret the observations, identify possible issues, explore relevant knowledge, and propose viable options for improvement.

Topics include distributional semantics with word embeddings, text classification, emotion recognition, sentiment analysis from text and speech, and language modeling, with neural networks and back-propagation, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We will also cover multi-linguality and multi-modality, end-to-end chatbots, and task-oriented dialogue systems. Students will learn about various natural language processing (NLP) tasks related to building interactive intelligent systems, how to design and build a deep learning model using PyTorch and Python, and the basics of software engineering. At the end of the course, students will work alone or in pairs to implement a deep learning model for various NLP research tasks, and describe their methods and results in a conference paper format. Successful groups will be able to submit their papers to an international conference."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3888","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2019-02-04T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-06T14:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2406, Lift 17-18 (76)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-02-01T09:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-03T10:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2406, Lift 17-18 (76)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["FUNG, Pascale"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"8","avail":"22","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"3889","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2019-02-05T18:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-07T18:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1011, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["FUNG, Pascale"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"8","avail":"22","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"COMP4901J","department":"COMP","code":"4901J","name":"Deep Learning for Computer Vision","credit":"3","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"COMP2012"}],"description":"The impact of computer vision has become increasing relevant in our daily life, with applications ranging from content-based retrieval, image understanding, to cartography, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars.

For instance, if the central bank tightens monetary policy by increasing interest rates, the cost of borrowing will rise and it will lower profit for a firm which relies on debt financing. The rising interest rates also lower the investment return for bondholders. If a country devalues its currency or defaults on its sovereign debt, creditors or investors from foreign countries will realize investment loss. This course introduces fundamental concepts of macroeconomic and financial risk management. It focuses on the identification, quantification, and management of various macroeconomic and financial risks.

To reduce those emissions, a variety of mitigation measures have been proposed. A measure that has emerged as favored by many jurisdictions is known as cap-and-trade. In this scheme, an overall limit is placed on atmospheric emissions of one or more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Rights to emit portions thereof are assigned to numerous emitters, but these rights are then allowed to be traded among emitters, so that lower-cost emission reducers can abate total emissions with more economic efficiency than higher-cost ones.

It is an investment approach that integrates three additional factors - environment (E), social (S) and governance (G), into security analysis and portfolio allocation. As the industry successfully adopts these factors into their double bottom line financial analysis, only a handful of courses - such as this one - would tackle the subject. This course will discuss the market terminology, practices, usages and dollar impact of ESG factors. The main focus is on the identification, measurement and the materiality of ESG indicators. The students will learn that financial analysis with ESG integration provides the basis for a more informed investment decision. Discussion on existing academic papers will shed light on the cost and benefits of sustainable investing.

Through the problem-solving approach, students will learn how to apply the design basics to create graphic design solutions. Although the course is focused on printed matter, design for the screen such as web sites will be discussed. Class time is devoted to lectures, exercises, and critiques where students are asked to evaluate each other’s work. Such evaluations are very important in the development of analytical thinking and communication proficiency."},"sections":[{"name":"LA1","class_number":"2324","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2019-02-04T14:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-06T15:50:00+08:00","location":"Multi-function Room, LG4, LIB","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHOI, Yuet Ngor"],"quota":{"total":"25","hold":{},"public":25},"enrol":"25","avail":"0","wait":"32","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"HART1039","department":"HART","code":"1039","name":"The Art of Narrative in Drama","credit":"1","details":{"attributes":["Arts"],"description":"Narrative is found in all forms of expressive arts. In drama, making a narrative is sometimes simply called story-telling, which is one of the earliest forms of performance. Understanding the art of narrative is fundamental to understanding and appreciating drama and other performing arts. Narrative forms, or stories, are building blocks of our cultural identity. The artistic skills of story-telling are therefore crucial in life events wherever communication of ideas and meaning-making of life experience is necessary. In this highly practical course, students will learn about how to structure a narrative by applying various drama and aesthetic elements. Through individual, paired and small group exercises, students will learn to narrate stories from various perspectives, investigate the use of dramatic language, acquire vocal and physical skills to make the story-telling more vivid and meaningful. By the end of the course, each student will create and perform a piece of original story-telling."},"sections":[{"name":"LA1","class_number":"2325","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2019-02-07T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-09T13:20:00+08:00","location":"LG5 Multi-function Room","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["LAI, Priscilla"],"quota":{"total":"20","hold":{},"public":20},"enrol":"17","avail":"3","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"HLTH1010","department":"HLTH","code":"1010","name":"Healthy Lifestyle","credit":"0","details":{"attributes":["HLTH"],"description":"A compulsory, one-year course for all undergraduates to learn how to maintain a well-balanced and healthy lifestyle that will help them to manage their lives, learning, transitions and holistic development.

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social

belong to different groups, each with its own set of identifying markers and priorities. These human identities and groupings are fundamentally informed by their historical past. This course is an exploration of human society through a historical analysis of the roots of these broad categories that we use to organize ourselves. The first value of “identity and community” examines the formation and changes in basic categories of differences in human society. These categories include ethnic, religious, and linguistic differences that gave rise to varying layers of identities that each individual may possess. Exploring the second value, “contact and conflict,” entails analyzing how these differences in identities caused competition over ideologies and resources. Finally, understanding the value of “justice and resolution” is an investigation of the ways through which human beings have devised ways to resolve conflicts and disputes within and between groups."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2372","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-02-01T11:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-03T13:20:00+08:00","location":"Lecture Theater A

Reading","credit":"3","details":{"attributes":["H","SSC-H"],"description":"The Four Books include the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean. As the embodiment of the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies of Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi and Zixi, they had long been venerated as sacred texts by Confucian scholars. They, however, did not form an organic set of philosophical treatises until Zhu Xi (1130-1200), the renowned Neo-Confucian great synthesizer in Southern-Song, grouped them together. Apart from giving them the specific format, Zhu also wrote them prefaces and commentaries, highlighting their themes and suggesting how they should be read and understood, as a result of which he produced the Collected Commentaries on the Four Books. Zhu’s commentaries, alongside with the Books upon which they elaborated, were the most widely read and, thus, the most influential Confucian texts from the early 14th Century onward up until the early 20th Century. The significance they had attained in late Imperial China can be compared to that of the Bible in medieval and early modern Europe. Their popularity, of course, had much to do with the fact that they constituted the core of the official curriculum for the Civil Service Examinations during those six centuries. But, what is even more fundamental is that as the fruit of a lifetime search for the ideal personality, Zhu’s Collected Commentaries was indeed a major source of inspiration for generations of Confucian gentlemen whose aspiration was nothing but to become a sage or a worthy. This course will guide students to read carefully through the lines of the Books, as well as those of Zhu’s commentaries, to investigate into the following questions: 1) What actually it was that constituted the Confucian education program of inner-sageliness and outer-kingliness? 2) What were the concrete methods that had been recommended for the achievement of those aims?, and 3) What were the underlying assumptions on which the whole education program was predicated? It is expected that through examining these crucial issues, students will not only appreciate better the essence of the Confucian teachings of learning to become a sage, but also gain a deeper understanding of the philosophy that lies behind: the peculiar metaphysics, philosophical anthropology, ethics, social and political philosophies that characterize the Confucian tradition."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2395","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2019-02-06T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-08T15:20:00+08:00","location":"Lecture Theater A (404)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"400","hold":{"SHSS":{"quota":"100","enrol":"6","avail":"94"}},"public":300},"enrol":"184","avail":"216","wait":"0","remarks":{"classnotes":"> For course details, please visit https://huma.ust.hk/teaching_learning/courses_ug2019spring_offering/"}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"2397","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2019-02-04T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-06T12:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 6573, Lift 29-30 (88)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"57","hold":{},"public":57},"enrol":"28","avail":"29","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T2","class_number":"2399","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2019-02-04T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-06T12:20:00+08:00","location":"TBA","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"57","hold":{},"public":57},"enrol":"1","avail":"56","wait":"0","remarks":{"classnotes":"> Venue : Room 6573"}},{"name":"T3","class_number":"2400","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2019-02-07T16:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-09T18:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1410, Lift 25-26 (60)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"57","hold":{},"public":57},"enrol":"57","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T4","class_number":"2401","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2019-02-07T16:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-09T18:20:00+08:00","location":"TBA","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"57","hold":{},"public":57},"enrol":"10","avail":"47","wait":"0","remarks":{"classnotes":"> Venue : Room 1410"}},{"name":"T5","class_number":"2402","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-02-01T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-03T12:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 6573, Lift 29-30 (88)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"57","hold":{},"public":57},"enrol":"56","avail":"1","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T6","class_number":"2403","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-02-01T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-03T12:20:00+08:00","location":"TBA","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"57","hold":{},"public":57},"enrol":"12","avail":"45","wait":"0","remarks":{"classnotes":"> Venue : Room 6573"}},{"name":"T7","class_number":"2404","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-02-01T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-03T16:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4619, Lift 31-32 (126)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Charles Wing Hoi"],"quota":{"total":"58","hold":{},"public":58},"enrol":"20","avail":"38","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"HUMA1100","department":"HUMA","code":"1100","name":"Music of the World","credit":"3","details":{"attributes":["Arts","H"],"description":"This is a survey course to study selected types of world music outside the Western European tradition.

We discuss specific ethnographic cases from all over the world with a concentration on the East Asian region. The course covers key anthropological concepts such as taboo, pollution, liminality, and dead body politics through both classic and contemporary ethnography. The three fundamental questions we ask throughout this course are: What happens when we die? What impacts does death have on social life? How can we better understand the politics and economy of death? Each question provides key elements of an understanding of the cultures of death and dead bodies. The course therefore aims to teach students to see the politics and economy of death and dead bodies as integral to the variety of cultures of death. It emphasizes an exploration of the power of the state and of capitalism, social relationships, and modern institutions as well as their impact on managing corpses, performing rituals, and regulating grief and mourning in the modern era."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2444","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-02-01T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-05-03T17:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2302, Lift 17-18 (74)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["LIU, Huwy-min"],"quota":{"total":"60","hold":{"SHSS":{"quota":"30","enrol":"26","avail":"4"}},"public":30},"enrol":"56","avail":"4","wait":"28","remarks":{"classnotes":"> For course details, please visit https://huma.ust.hk/teaching_learning/courses_ug2019spring_offering/"}}]},{"id":"HUMA2840","department":"HUMA","code":"2840","name":"Buddhism and the Chinese Intellectual Tradition","credit":"3","details":{"attributes":["H"],"description":"This course will introduce the basic ideas of Buddhism, the main schools of Buddhism in China and their historical development.

The course presents a comparative-theoretical analysis based on real-time close-range investigation of Palestinian terrorism attacks in Israel during the Intifada, focusing on the arena of explosion where the disguised perpetrator and his/her target meet. Exploration of suicide terrorism uses firsthand materials produced by unconventional research methods and hitherto classified sources, revising the current discussion on the strategic logic of suicide terrorism and suggesting original insights on its moral logic. Suicide terrorism's exceptionally coercive as well as subversive impact is explained in terms of its paradoxical nature; especially the peculiar inherent link between aggressor and victim.

The process begins from defining real-world problems through to initiating changes to society. This unique process has been studied as “design science”, which refers to the design approach of exploring and developing new ideas as well as scientific approach of proving and demonstrating innovations. The two merges into a rational yet inventive designerly way of thinking and doing. This is the creative process that students are guided to undergo phase by phase.

Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). It emphasizes the contribution of Japan's indigenous market economy and state-building efforts to Japan's modernization. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan. It provides a more nuanced picture of its modernization, as well as highlight the multiple trajectories of development that were possible in Japan.
