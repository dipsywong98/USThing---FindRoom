These suggest that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze the microeconomic issues of housing. Besides, a significant number of households own residential properties by borrowing mortgages. A substantial collapse in housing prices might lead to negative equity for those households, and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. Therefore, the macroeconomic implication of housing market dynamics cannot be overstated. The US subprime mortgage crisis during 2007-09 suggests that a sharp downturn in the housing market can cause negative spillovers to the aggregate economy. The first part of this course focuses on microeconomic issues like housing demand and supply analysis, models of housing market, rationales and effects of government’s housing policies. The second part emphasizes the macroeconomic issues such as the stylized facts on housing market dynamics, causes of housing market fluctuations, and housing market spillovers. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed. The objective of this course is to develop analytical frameworks by which students can address both the microeconomic and macroeconomic issues of housing."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2264","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2019-09-03T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-11-26T16:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1005, LSK Bldg (70)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2019-09-05T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-11-28T16:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1005, LSK Bldg (70)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["NG, Chi Yung"],"quota":{"total":"50","hold":{"ECON":{"quota":"50","enrol":"21","avail":"29"}},"public":0},"enrol":"28","avail":"22","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"2265","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2019-09-03T18:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-11-26T18:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1014, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["NG, Chi Yung"],"quota":{"total":"50","hold":{},"public":50},"enrol":"28","avail":"22","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"ECON4999O","department":"ECON","code":"4999O","name":"Economics of Financial Technology","credit":"2","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"ECON3014"}],"description":"Financial technology refers to technological innovation that results in new business processes or products with an material effect on the financial industry.

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2317","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2019-09-04T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-11-27T12:20:00+08:00","location":"Lecture Theater A

The exclaimed course title, on one hand, expresses with the amazement well suited to a change-making process; on another hand, upsets the rigid design thinking processes that are prevalently used nowadays. Problem solving is an everyday activity and yet, designers’ problem-solving is not the same as most classic problem-solving processes but is disorderly, creative and aesthetic, which has been studied as appropriate to tackle problems for societal changes. In the course, students tap into the designerly approach to experience the change-making process. The course is completed in four weeks wherein the fundamentals are adequately introduced through project-based learning. The course is suitable for students from all schools while students with particular prior learning experience will enhance their understanding in this course.

This unique process has been studied as “design science”, which refers to the design approach of exploring and developing new ideas as well as scientific approach of proving and demonstrating innovations. The two merges into a rational yet inventive designerly way of thinking and doing. This is the creative process that students are guided to undergo phase by phase. As a result, students are able to develop and justify good designs. By adding design perspective, technological development likely results in useful innovations meeting real-world problems.

students with persuasive communication skills, both oral and written, through analyzing business cases and presenting solutions to problems identified. It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills.

Today in whatever organization we work in we are expected to work in a team structure. In some cases we work in teams that meet face to face, in others we need to work with people who we may never meet physically and only over the phone or video. In both situations understanding what drives effective collaboration and performance is critical. Unfortunately few leaders and organisations are well-prepared to lead or to participate well in teams. This is due to a combination of factors related to the way people are used to interacting with each other in groups, cultural differences, personality diversity and emotional needs. This course will cover all of those areas using a mix of the latest management theory on team performance, Harvard case studies and online simulations, competitive experiential group exercises, classroom discussions and individual personality assessments.

An accurate daily weather forecast in the modern era relies not only on our intellectual understanding of the atmosphere, but also on the real-time monitoring and numerical modelling of atmospheric motions. Both of them are fruitful applications of atmospheric physics. In recent decades, there has been growing concern over human impacts on global climate. The wide-ranging claims of human-induced climate change have to be supported by scientific theories and evidence. Atmosphere physics plays a central role in such debates as the atmosphere is a core component of the climate system.

We will then discuss the methodological and analytical strategies of these two paradigms of ethnographic research. Next, we examine the logic of formulating research questions, sampling, casing, comparison, inter-subjectivity in interviews, concept formation, theoretical construction, ethical and political issues in doing ethnographic fieldwork. For those continuing with the second part of the course in the Spring Semester, we will work together on ethnographic projects related to public sociological issues in Hong Kong.

He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and variations, namely, robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk (e.g., CVaR or ES), regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix via random matrix theory, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, mean models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on R programming. Each week will be devoted to a specific topic, during which the theory will be first presented, followed by an exposition of a practical implementation based on R programing."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"1393","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2019-09-03T19:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-11-26T22:20:00+08:00","location":"Lecture Theater E (143)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["PEREZ PALOMAR, Daniel"],"quota":{"total":"140","hold":{},"public":140},"enrol":"66","avail":"74","wait":"0","remarks":{"classnotes":"> For MSc(MAFM) students only."}}]},{"id":"MAFS6010T","department":"MAFS","code":"6010T","name":"Capstone Project II in Financial Mathematics","credit":"3","details":{"vector":"[3-0-0:3]","description":"This course is highly similar in instruction to MAFS 6010Q but offered in different semesters of the academic year."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"1394","classes":"TBA","instructors":["CHEN, Kani"],"quota":{"total":"100","hold":{},"public":100},"enrol":"0","avail":"100","wait":"0","remarks":{"consent":true,"classnotes":"> For MSc(MAFM) students only.|\n> Students should seek the instructor's approval to take this course."}}]},{"id":"MAFS6100A","department":"MAFS","code":"6100A","name":"Independent Project","credit":"3","details":{"vector":"[3 credits]","description":"Completion of an independent project under the supervisor of a faculty in financial mathematics or statistics.

In addition, the course also furthers an understanding of consumer behavior by examining its social and cultural context, including the influence of group members (such as family and other important referents) on decision making and perception, and the nature and importance of cultural differences in consumer behaviour around the world. Thus, this course both a micro and macro perspective on the factors influencing a customer."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"1491","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2019-09-04T14:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-09-04T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 3001, LSK Bldg","note":"04-SEP-2019 - 04-SEP-2019"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-09-06T14:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-09-13T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2001, LSK Bldg","note":"06-SEP-2019 - 13-SEP-2019"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2019-09-11T14:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-09-11T17:20:00+08:00","location":"G003, LSK Bldg (70)","note":"11-SEP-2019 - 11-SEP-2019"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2019-09-27T14:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-10-11T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2001, LSK Bldg","note":"27-SEP-2019 - 11-OCT-2019"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2019-10-02T14:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2019-10-02T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 3001, LSK Bldg","note":"02-OCT-2019 - 02-OCT-2019"}],"instructors":["DALTON, Amy Nicole"],"quota":{"total":"60","hold":{},"public":60},"enrol":"49","avail":"11","wait":"0","remarks":{"classnotes":"> For MSc(IMT) students only|\n> Add/Drop Deadline : 05-Sep-2019"}}]},{"id":"MIMT5350","department":"MIMT","code":"5350","name":"Project Management","credit":"2","details":{"vector":"[2-0-0:2]","exclusion":[{"course":"ISOM5460"}],"description":"This course covers the essential project management skills to ensure successful implementation of business projects.
