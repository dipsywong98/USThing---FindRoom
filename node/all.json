The objective of this course is to equip our next generation leaders in different disciplines with enhanced environmental awareness and knowledge of tools and solutions to environmental issues. They will therefore be able to make responsible decisions and actions, with due consideration of the environment and sustainability. Each lesson is divided into two parts. The first part is the introduction and discussion of essential concepts and environmental issues and debates of these issues and will be delivered and guided by the instructor.

These suggest that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze the microeconomic issues of housing. Besides, a significant number of households own residential properties by borrowing mortgages. A substantial collapse in housing prices might lead to negative equity for those households, and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. Therefore, the macroeconomic implication of housing market dynamics cannot be overstated. The US subprime mortgage crisis during 2007-09 suggests that a sharp downturn in the housing market can cause negative spillovers to the aggregate economy. The first part of this course focuses on microeconomic issues like housing demand and supply analysis, models of housing market, rationales and effects of government’s housing policies. The second part emphasizes the macroeconomic issues such as the stylized facts on housing market dynamics, causes of housing market fluctuations, and housing market spillovers. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed. The objective of this course is to develop analytical frameworks by which students can address both the microeconomic and macroeconomic issues of housing."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3885","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2018-09-05T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-28T14:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1001, LSK Bldg (70)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2018-09-07T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-30T14:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1001, LSK Bldg (70)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":"TBA","quota":{"total":"50","hold":{"ECON":{"quota":"50","enrol":"17","avail":"33"}},"public":0},"enrol":"17","avail":"33","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"3886","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2018-09-04T18:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-27T18:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1014, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":"TBA","quota":{"total":"50","hold":{},"public":50},"enrol":"17","avail":"33","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"ECON5050","department":"ECON","code":"5050","name":"China’s Economic Model : Key Insights and the Way Forward","credit":"2","details":{"vector":"[2-0-0:2]","exclusion":[{"course":"ECON5120"}],"previous code":[{"course":"ECON6100V"}],"description":"The course overviews the key characteristics of the Chinese economy with a big emphasis on its transformation.

His theory of syllogism has had a great influence on the history of Western thought. Mencius and Aristotle were contemporaries.

For both Aristotle and Mencius, the logic of arguments and the art of rhetoric are the chief weapons in the service of truth.

The process begins from defining real-world problems through to initiating changes to society. This unique process has been studied as “design science”, which refers to the design approach of exploring and developing new ideas as well as scientific approach of proving and demonstrating innovations. The two merges into a rational yet inventive designerly way of thinking and doing. This is the creative process that students are guided to undergo phase by phase.

The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills.

This introductive course on some modern topics of mechanics of defects in solids aims at providing a fundamental understanding and modelling tools of many physical and mechanical properties of solids. It also provides powerful quantitative and rigorous approaches to the mechanics of materials. A brief and integrated view on various roles of defects in mechanics and physics of solids is established through selected topics. The basic concepts, equations and methods used in the mechanics analysis of various kinds of defects by continuum mechanics and thermodynamics approaches are introduced. Typical types of defects - cracks, dislocations, inclusions and inhomogeneities, grain boundaries and phase boundaries - are described intensively with illustrative examples provided. The applications of the theory in the mechanics analysis of fracture of engineering materials and solid-solid phase transformation process in smart materials and structures are demonstrated. This course is intended for graduate and senior graduate students who have a reasonable background in solid mechanics (such as theory of elasticity and plasticity, continuum mechanics) and material science. It can be used either as an introductory course for graduate students who study in solid mechanics and material streams in general or as special topics for senior graduate students whose research topics are related to the plasticity, damage, fracture and phase transition process of engineering materials. This course emphasizes basic principles rather than factual information. It will focus on the explanation of the basic physics ideas, hypotheses, assumptions and approaches in this subject. It also serves to help students to obtain clear physical pictures about fracture and phase transformation phenomena in solid materials."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"1416","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2018-09-05T18:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-28T21:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 5506, Lift 25-26 (30)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["SUN, Qingping"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"0","avail":"30","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"MECH6910M","department":"MECH","code":"6910M","name":"Robot Manipulation","credit":"3","details":{"vector":"[3-0-0:3]","description":"Extensive introduction to robot manipulation theory from a geometric viewpoint.

After that, we will discuss the material time derivative, the incompressibility, the Lagrangian description and the Euler description followed by the conservation and balance laws. Then, we will give a underlying mathematical framework for the description of periodic structures, i.e. crystalline solids. This part includes the definition of Bravais lattice in 2D and 3D, reciprocal lattice, point group and space group. We will show how the lattice symmetry operation and laws of mechanics are related, and derive a mathematicalmodel for the determination of transformation strain between crystalline solids of different symmetries.

The course will emphasize a theoretical understanding of human decision making, as well as a comprehension of the real world implications of our mistakes both for us and for our society, and what, if anything, can be done about it."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3436","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2018-09-05T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-28T14:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1034, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2018-09-07T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-30T14:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1034, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["NG, Ka Man"],"quota":{"total":"60","hold":{},"public":60},"enrol":"60","avail":"0","wait":"11","remarks":{}},{"name":"L2","class_number":"3437","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2018-09-05T16:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-28T17:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1034, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2018-09-07T16:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-30T17:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1034, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["NG, Ka Man"],"quota":{"total":"60","hold":{},"public":60},"enrol":"27","avail":"33","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"L3","class_number":"3438","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2018-09-05T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-28T16:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1034, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2018-09-07T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2018-11-30T16:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1034, LSK Bldg (80)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["NG, Ka Man"],"quota":{"total":"60","hold":{},"public":60},"enrol":"60","avail":"0","wait":"15","remarks":{}}]},{"id":"MGMT2010","department":"MGMT","code":"2010","name":"Business Ethics and the Individual","credit":"2","details":{"previous code":[{"course":"SBMT2010"}],"description":"This course presents and exemplifies three major traditions of ethical thought in East and West moral philosophy - namely utilitarianism, principle-based ethics and virtue-based ethics. Employing guest speakers, lectures, cases, contemporary readings, role-plays, fieldwork, reflective student writing, and discussion groups, the course engages students in a serious consideration of their own ethical standards as applied to their present academic environment and their future careers. Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions.

Using films to illustrate the correct (or wrong) concepts of physics is a good way to help the students to comprehend and apply the basic principles of science in an enjoyable way. Movies and films also frequently describes, sometimes in a grossly exaggerated manner, the dire consequences when science or technology falls in the hands of the bad people or when good science is applied for a wrong purpose by unsuspecting people who have good intentions.

He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and variations, namely, robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk (e.g., CVaR or ES), regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix via random matrix theory, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, mean models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on R programming.
