The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data.

For instance, if the central bank tightens monetary policy by increasing interest rates, the cost of borrowing will rise and it will lower profit for a firm which relies on debt financing. The rising interest rates also lower the investment return for bondholders. If a country devalues its currency or defaults on its sovereign debt, creditors or investors from foreign countries will realize investment loss. This course introduces fundamental concepts of macroeconomic and financial risk management.

Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day‐to‐day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour‐based, cognitive and biologically-inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human‐machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. The learning process is designed to transcend conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and will be facilitated by a series of demonstrative sessions presenting students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions enabled by robotic and automation technology. In this exploration process, students will be encouraged to apply their personal background and interests, and possibly experiment with robot kits."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2085","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2020-02-11T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-05T11:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 6591, Lift 31-32 (88)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-02-13T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-07T11:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 6591, Lift 31-32 (88)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["WANG, Michael Yu"],"quota":{"total":"40","hold":{},"public":40},"enrol":"30","avail":"10","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"2086","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2020-02-12T12:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-06T12:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 1511, Lift 27-28 (42)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["WANG, Michael Yu"],"quota":{"total":"40","hold":{},"public":40},"enrol":"30","avail":"10","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},"ELEC1100":{"id":"ELEC1100","department":"ELEC","code":"1100","name":"Introduction to Electro-Robot Design","credit":"4","details":{"description":"The course introduces the fundamental knowledge on the design, implementation and evaluation of a robot and its sub-systems.

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2173","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2020-02-12T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-06T16:20:00+08:00","location":"G003, CYT Bldg (30)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-02-07T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-08T16:20:00+08:00","location":"G003, CYT Bldg (30)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["PEREZ PALOMAR, Daniel"],"quota":{"total":"15","hold":{},"public":15},"enrol":"7","avail":"8","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},"ELEC3200":{"id":"ELEC3200","department":"ELEC","code":"3200","name":"System Modeling, Analysis and Control","credit":"4","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"ELEC2100"}],"exclusion":[{"course":"CENG3110"},{"course":"MECH3610"}],"description":"This course introduces basic concepts, tools and techniques for modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems.

We then explore several conceptual tools that can help us overcome these mistakes. We pay specific attention to building new skills associated with sustainability, like systems thinking, futures thinking, strategic thinking, values thinking, and complex problem solving.

Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts.

Centering around the self's relationship with family and the society, the course will address the following issues as reflected in a range of readings of Western and Chinese writings, literature, film and cultural texts: conceptions of the self; universal and culturally particular aspects of ethics and human nature; different conceptions of individual emotions (romantic love in particular); as well as the appreciation of beauty and art. Students will be introduced to key concepts concerning individual morality, feelings and social responsibilities, and to the ways in which nationality, family, the society, and other affiliations have been constructed in modern narratives of identity and selfhood. This introductory humanities course aims to develop students' critical thinking and writing skills, while cultivating their moral sensibilities and abilities to become well-rounded individuals."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2437","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-02-07T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-08T12:20:00+08:00","location":"Lecture Theater A (404)","note":"07-FEB-2020 -

Zhu Xi's Reading","credit":"3","details":{"attributes":["H","SSC-H"],"description":"The Four Books include the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean. As the embodiment of the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies of Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi and Zixi, they had long been venerated as sacred texts by Confucian scholars. They, however, did not form an organic set of philosophical treatises until Zhu Xi (1130-1200), the renowned Neo-Confucian great synthesizer in Southern-Song, grouped them together. Apart from giving them the specific format, Zhu also wrote them prefaces and commentaries, highlighting their themes and suggesting how they should be read and understood, as a result of which he produced the Collected Commentaries on the Four Books. Zhu’s commentaries, alongside with the Books upon which they elaborated, were the most widely read and, thus, the most influential Confucian texts from the early 14th Century onward up until the early 20th Century. The significance they had attained in late Imperial China can be compared to that of the Bible in medieval and early modern Europe. Their popularity, of course, had much to do with the fact that they constituted the core of the official curriculum for the Civil Service Examinations during those six centuries. But, what is even more fundamental is that as the fruit of a lifetime search for the ideal personality, Zhu’s Collected Commentaries was indeed a major source of inspiration for generations of Confucian gentlemen whose aspiration was nothing but to become a sage or a worthy. This course will guide students to read carefully through the lines of the Books, as well as those of Zhu’s commentaries, to investigate into the following questions: 1) What actually it was that constituted the Confucian education program of inner-sageliness and outer-kingliness? 2) What were the concrete methods that had been recommended for the achievement of those aims?, and 3) What were the underlying assumptions on which the whole education program was predicated?

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"2550","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2020-02-12T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-06T16:20:00+08:00","location":"G003, CYT Bldg (30)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-02-07T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-08T16:20:00+08:00","location":"G003, CYT Bldg (30)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["PEREZ PALOMAR, Daniel"],"quota":{"total":"15","hold":{},"public":15},"enrol":"7","avail":"8","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},"IEDA3230":{"id":"IEDA3230","department":"IEDA","code":"3230","name":"Engineering Economics and Accounting","credit":"3","details":{"previous code":[{"course":"IELM3230"}],"description":"Application of microeconomics to engineering and managerial decision making.

This is a project-based course to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3521","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-02-10T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-02-24T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4225C, Lift 23, 24","note":"10-FEB-2020 - 24-FEB-2020"},{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-03-02T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-03-02T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"02-MAR-2020 - 02-MAR-2020"},{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-03-09T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-04T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"09-MAR-2020 - 04-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["MA, Lok Wang"],"quota":{"total":"44","hold":{"MECH":{"quota":"5","enrol":"5","avail":"0"}},"public":39},"enrol":"34","avail":"10","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"L2","class_number":"3524","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-02-13T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-02-27T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4225C, Lift 23, 24","note":"13-FEB-2020 - 27-FEB-2020"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-03-05T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-03-05T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"05-MAR-2020 - 05-MAR-2020"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-03-12T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-07T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"12-MAR-2020 - 07-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["MA, Lok Wang"],"quota":{"total":"43","hold":{"MECH":{"quota":"4","enrol":"4","avail":"0"}},"public":39},"enrol":"43","avail":"0","wait":"2","remarks":{}},{"name":"L3","class_number":"3457","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-02-07T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-02-28T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4225C, Lift 23, 24","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 28-FEB-2020"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-03-06T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-03-06T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"06-MAR-2020 - 06-MAR-2020"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-03-13T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-08T14:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"13-MAR-2020 - 08-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["MA, Lok Wang"],"quota":{"total":"43","hold":{"MECH":{"quota":"5","enrol":"5","avail":"0"}},"public":38},"enrol":"41","avail":"2","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"LA1","class_number":"3448","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-02-10T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-02-24T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4225C, Lift 23, 24","note":"10-FEB-2020 - 24-FEB-2020"},{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-03-02T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-03-02T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"02-MAR-2020 - 02-MAR-2020"},{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-03-09T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-04T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"09-MAR-2020 - 04-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["MA, Lok Wang"],"quota":{"total":"44","hold":{},"public":44},"enrol":"34","avail":"10","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"LA2","class_number":"3450","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-02-13T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-02-27T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4225C, Lift 23, 24","note":"13-FEB-2020 - 27-FEB-2020"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-03-05T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-03-05T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"05-MAR-2020 - 05-MAR-2020"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-03-12T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-07T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"12-MAR-2020 - 07-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["MA, Lok Wang"],"quota":{"total":"43","hold":{},"public":43},"enrol":"43","avail":"0","wait":"2","remarks":{}},{"name":"LA3","class_number":"3451","classes":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-02-07T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-02-28T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 4225C, Lift 23, 24","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 28-FEB-2020"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-03-06T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-03-06T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"06-MAR-2020 - 06-MAR-2020"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2020-03-13T14:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-08T17:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2136, Lift 22","note":"13-MAR-2020 - 08-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["MA, Lok Wang"],"quota":{"total":"43","hold":{},"public":43},"enrol":"41","avail":"2","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},"MECH3620":{"id":"MECH3620","department":"MECH","code":"3620","name":"Aircraft Design","credit":"3","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"MECH1907"}],"co-requisite":[{"course":"MECH3660"}],"description":"Students will work in teams to develop a conceptual design for a complete flight vehicle, using knowledge and skills acquired in the Aerospace Engineering Major curriculum.

High profile incidents such as the A380 engine explosion in Singapore in 2010, and Deepwater Horizon accident were caused by undetected cracks in either turbine blades or pressure vessels. The importance of NDE is clear as it can avoid these risks by finding a crack in time. NDE is one of the key elements to ensure the quality of manufacturing and evaluate whether it is still safe to use an aircraft engine after many years. This course will introduce the basic ingredients of NDE techniques. We will cover different NDE approaches, including visual, penetrant, eddy current, x-ray and ultrasound. We focus on ultrasonic NDE because it is the most widely used, and it is very popular in the aviation industry (e.g. HASEL, HAECO in HK and Rolls Royce in UK). For ultrasonic NDE, we will start from very basic acoustic/ultrasonic knowledge to practical inspection methods and more advanced techniques. The lectures will be associated with real industrial application examples from my personal consulting experiences in the aerospace and nuclear industry.

The lectures cover decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that deal with the business activities of multinational private and state-owned corporations. The lectures examine how domestic, regional, and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. Moreover, the lectures explain to students how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment activities, ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students, and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3589","classes":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"2020-02-10T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-04T17:50:00+08:00","location":"G009B, CYT Bldg (70)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["SEJKO, Dini"],"quota":{"total":"40","hold":{"MGMT":{"quota":"40","enrol":"19","avail":"21"}},"public":0},"enrol":"19","avail":"21","wait":"3","remarks":{}}]},"MGMT4000E":{"id":"MGMT4000E","department":"MGMT","code":"4000E","name":"Knowing and Managing Your Social Networks for Careers and Business","credit":"3","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"MGMT2110"}],"description":"Network is an important determinant of success in one’s careers and business, yet the understanding of its role is often ill-conceived or simply mystified.

First, students will learn key concepts (and also common mis-concepts) of social network through readings, on-line and in-class simulations.

Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's indigenous resources of economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). Against this historical background, it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration, foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan's political development. Japan's indigenous development of market economy, state-building, and local representative assemblies contribute significantly to Japan's rapid rise as a regional power in 1905 and a world power after 1918. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan, provide them with the analytic skill and critical thinking over the issue of Japan's political and economic modernization. By highlighting the parallel processes of military development and the development of democracy in Japan between 1895 and 1931, this course will help the students to have a better understanding of the rise and collapse of democracy in pre-Japan. This course will help the students to view the relationship between Japan and China from a historical perspective."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3813","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2020-02-11T12:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-05T13:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2502, Lift 25-26 (120)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2020-02-13T12:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2020-05-07T13:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2502, Lift 25-26 (120)","note":"07-FEB-2020 - 09-MAY-2020"}],"instructors":["HE, Wenkai"],"quota":{"total":"120","hold":{"SHSS":{"quota":"50","enrol":"24","avail":"26"}},"public":70},"enrol":"94","avail":"26","wait":"29","remarks":{}}]},"SOSC1661":{"id":"SOSC1661","department":"SOSC","code":"1661","name":"Contemporary Hong Kong: Government & Politics","credit":"3","details":{"attributes":["SA","SSC-SA"],"exclusion":[{"course":"SOSC1662"},{"course":"SOSC1663"}],"description":"By unfolding the multi-dimensions of Hong Kong 's political system, political culture, and political dynamics before and after its handover, this course aims to review the factors shaping the governance of Hong Kong.
